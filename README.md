# Mounds_Array-Based-Concurrent-Priority-Queue
This is an implementation of an array-based concurrent priority queue in C language, which supports insert and getmin operations.

# Overview
The priority queue is implemented using a binary heap data structure. The binary heap is stored as an array of integers. The queue supports concurrent access by using the built-in C11 atomic operations.
