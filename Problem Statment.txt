You need to implement the mound data structure explained in Section 2 of the paper. You don't need consider the other sections of the paper. Implement the mound and insert all the objects present in data.txt. Implement all other operations present in the paper. If there are any parameters to be chosen, you can choose them by your choice.

Then write a function that repeatedly performs removeMin() operation and prints the extracted object each time, until all the objects in the mound are exhausted.
